Spaceship Controls

![Your Cockpit](images/main_cockpit_screenshot01.jpg "Cockpit")  
*Your cockpit has a lot of complex-looking and unlabled controls. Luckily, you only need to become familiar with a few in order to perform basic navigation tasks.*  

![The light switch](images/01.png)  
1. This is probably the very first control you'll come into contact with in *Mirror Moon.* Its purpose is very simple: it turns on the cabin lights. If you press it again, it turns them off.
